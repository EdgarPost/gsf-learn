## Contributing a Translation

We welcome community contributed translations of the course.

### Prepare your translation

To make the process simpler we have created a [locale template](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/learn/tree/main/i18n/template) that you can duplicate and update -

To prepare your translation follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository: https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/learn/fork
2. Create a new branch for your translation - e.g. "translation-de".
3. Duplicate the template folder - "/i18n/template".
4. Name the new folder based on the language locale code - (e.g. 'de' for German) https://simplelocalize.io/data/locales/
5. Update the course content in the "docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current" folder.
6. Optionally update the images in "docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/images". Contact us if you need access to the original image assets.
7. Update the UI elements in "docusaurus-theme-classic/footer.json" & "docusaurus-theme-classic/navbar.json".

### Submit for review

1. Raise a Pull Request for your translation against the **main** branch.
2. The PR will be reviewed by the the project team and feedback will be provided within 4 weeks.

### Go Live

Once approved the translation will be published on https://learn.greensoftware.foundation/
